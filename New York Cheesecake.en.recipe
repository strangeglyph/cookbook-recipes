# For the crust

- 200 g graham cracker crumbs
- 30 g unsalted butter, melted
- salt
Combine the crumbs, melted butter, and a pinch of salt in the pan and mix with a fork
until well combined. Season to taste with additional salt if needed. Press firmly into
an even layer across the bottom of the pan with your fingers.
-> crust

# For the cheesecake

- 1 lime
-> lime zest
-> lime juice
Zest and juice one lime.

- 900 g full-fat cream cheese
- 225 g fresh goat cheese
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- .25 tsp orange flower or rose water
- .5 tsp allspice
- .5 tsp turmeric
- salt
= crust
= lime zest
= lime juice
Preheat the oven to 230°C. Combine the everything in a bowl. Mix on low until roughly
combined, then increase to medium and beat until perfectly smooth with no lumps, about
5 minutes. Pause halfway through to scrape down the bowl and paddle.

- 400 g sugar
Add sugar all at once, and mix only until well combined. Scrape the bowl and paddle once more.

- 6 large eggs
Whisk the eggs through a fine-mesh sieve into the bowl. On low, mix until combined. 
Scrape the bowl and paddle.

- 170 g heavy cream
Bring the cream to a full boil in a small saucepan. On low, pour in the
hot cream in a steady stream and mix for a few seconds more.


Pour the batter into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bounce a spoon lightly
across the surface to dislodge any air bubbles. Bake at 230°C until the surface is puffed
and dry to the touch around the edges, about 20 minutes

Turn off the oven, open the door and let it stand ajar for 10 minutes. Close the door
and reduce to 120°C. Continue baking until the outer edge feels firm but the innermost
5–6 cm wobbles freely when the pan is shaken, about 35 minutes more. The cheesecake is
done when the very centre reads 63°C on a digital thermometer inserted to a depth of
5 cm. Do not overbake - cracking is caused solely by overbaking.

Let cool for 15 minutes, then run a thin knife around the sides to loosen. Cool at
room temperature for at least 1 hour, then cover and refrigerate until cold to the core,
at least 12 hours. Before then, it will be very fragile and probably break apart when
unmolding.
