      <div>
      Bring a pan without oil to medium heat. Divide dough in eight roughly equally sized pieces. Form each into a ball,
      then press flat with your hand. Pull on the edges to turn it into a round plate, roughly the size of your hand.
      Bake in a pan on both sides until brown. Every two to three naan, wipe the pan with some kitchen towels to get rid
      of burnt flour.
