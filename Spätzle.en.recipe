- 2 eggs
- 290 g flour
- salt
- water
<p>Attach the base firmly to the cup. Crack the eggs into the cup, fill with water up to the
marked line and add 1 slightly heaped tsp of salt. Whisk well and check the liquid level
once more. Leave the whisk in the cup and add the flour.</p>
<p>Place the lid with the white slider onto the cup - the slider protrudes a few mm so the
lid sits at an angle. Pull the whisk upward with a twisting motion, then continue moving it
up and down with a twisting motion for about 1 minute. Finally pull the whisk all the way
up to the lid, slide the slider to the centre to lock the whisk in place, then push the
whole lid down onto the dough.</p>
<p>Rest for 20 minutes.</p>


<p>Meanwhile fill a large pot halfway with water, bring to a boil and salt generously. Place
the pan insert over the rim of the pot.</p>
<p>Invert the cup, remove the base and place the Spätzle maker in the opening of the pan
insert - caution, the dough will start running out immediately. Push the whisk and lid about
halfway into the boiling water, pulling it up briefly once during cooking.</p>
<p>After half the dough has cooked, set the maker aside. Stir the Spätzle in the pot to
prevent sticking. After 1-2 minutes lift them out with a slotted spoon, drain in a sieve
and toss with a little rapeseed oil. Repeat with the second half of the dough.</p>

- 1 tbsp butter
Heat the butter in a pan and fry the Spätzle until golden.
