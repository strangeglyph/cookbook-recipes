    instructions: >-
      Preheat a pan without oil to medium heat. Place circular cookie cutters (diameter around 8cm) in the pan.
      Fill each cookie cutter to around 1.5cm in height with the batter. Bake in the pan until the top is dry. If you feel
      the bottom starts to get too dark, instead remove the crumpet from the cookie cutter and flip to finish.
