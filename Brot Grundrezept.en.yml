    instructions: >-
      Mix everything together until you have a stiff dough. Over the next couple of hours (until the dough has
      doubled or tripled) fold the dough in regular
      (30 to 45 minute) intervals. I.e. From one side of the bowl, put your hand under the dough. Pull up until the dough
      almost starts tearing, then fold over to the other side. Rotate bowl 90° and repeat all this until you have made a full
      rotation around the bowl.

    instructions: >-
      Divide dough into 4 equally large parts. Fold each on the (unfloured!) worktop into a square or rough sphere, flip
      and with small pulling motions shape into a boule. Bake in a dutch oven at 220°C (convection): First 30 minutes with the lid on,
      then another 15 minutes without the lid.
