    instructions: >-
      Butter a 1.5-2 liter ceramic or metal bowl. Place a circle of parchment paper in the bottom. Pack in the pudding
      mixture. Put a layer of parchment paper on top of the pudding. Pleat it in the middle to allow for expansion and 
      crimp it around the edges of the bowl to prevent water from coming in. Wrap the bowl in two layers of aluminum
      foil as well. Place in a large pot. Fill in enough water to cover bowl half-way. Bring to a simmer and steam for
      six to eight hours, replacing water as needed. Remove from pot, let cool, then unwrap.
      
      Store in the fridge, soaking with rum occasionally.
